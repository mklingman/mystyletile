					Well well, so here we have the <strong>strong parts</strong> and <em>emphasized parts</em>. William Seward Burroughs was an acclaimed essayist, novelist, short story writer, performer and an incredible painter. Known worldwide as "William Lee", he was appreciated for his innovative arts, political views and culturally influential personality. William authored four essay collections, six short story series and eighteen novels in his life time. Even his interviews and correspondences were published in a series of five books. Lee, who had studied English at Harvard and Anthropology in Vienna, was incredibly talented in all art forms. After the U.S. Navy turned down his request of serving in World War II, he worked a variety of odd jobs in London, Mexico city, Tangier, Berlin, Paris and Amazon. The satirist rose to fame with his confessional novel Junkie in 1953. Thereafter, he produced some incredible pieces like the Nova Triology, The Red Night Triology, The Adding Machine and The Burroughs File. His controversial third novel "Naked Lunch" landed him in a court case, after it was challenged for violating the U.S. sodomy laws.
